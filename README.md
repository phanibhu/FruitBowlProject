## Challenge : Imagine you have been using a single bowl for storing fruits for a long time,
		    Now you are finding the current bowl to be small, so you have bought a new basket stand that is multi-layered 
		    and will look much cleaner as you can segregate fruits better.Now the goal is to segregate fruits from the 
		    current bowl to the multilayer fruit basket. You can choose any set of fruits and arrange them 
              based on any parameter; colour, name, size etc.
## Information About Project :

* This code consists of three classes: Fruit, FruitBowl, and MultiLayerBowl.
* Fruit class defines the properties of a fruit, such as name and color, and provides getter methods for those properties.
* FruitBowl class is a collection of Fruit objects. It provides methods to add and remove fruits to/from the collection,
  and get the list of fruits in the bowl.
* MultiLayerBowl class is a collection of Fruit objects segregated by their color.
  It provides a method to segregate fruits from a FruitBowl object and get the segregated fruits as a Map object.

### Tests :

* There are three test classes: FruitTest, FruitBowlTest, and MultiLayerBowlTest, which test the functionality of
  the corresponding classes.
* FruitTest tests the getter methods of the Fruit class.
* FruitBowlTest tests the add and remove methods of the FruitBowl class.
* MultiLayerBowlTest tests the segregation method of the MultiLayerBowl class.
